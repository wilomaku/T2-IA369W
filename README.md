Exploratory data analisys

This is an exploratory analysis of brain MRI data. The corpus callosum is the greatest white matter subcortical structure. Its segmentation is mandatory for any 
analysis. When evaluating segmentation, it is used a ground-truth. In this work, we have several measurements of the corpus callosum segmentation for 145 subjects
using 3 references (ground-truth). The questions approached in the notebook are:

* In this work, is RMSE correlated with the other metrics: Sensibility, Especificity, Dice, Hausdorff distance, and Area.
* What are the operation zones of the RMSE?
* Is RMSE a good metric to evaluate corpus callosum segmentation?
